My Minetest texture pack, BaseTweaks

This texture pack is not designed to be fully-featured;
rather, it is a supplement for the base texture pack and
for servers running MineClone. It works fine for Minetest
Game running locally or on a server, but looks pretty bad
when used on a local game of MineClone.

## To use with Minetest Game
Just use the texture pack like you would with any other
texture pack, nothing different.

## To use with MineClone
### Running locally
Get REFI-Textures, then put the basetweaks folder inside
of the refi folder.

### Playing on a server
Just enable the basetweaks texture pack. However, this
works well only when the server is using a Minecraft-like
texture pack. If it isn't, use the directions for running
locally, above.
